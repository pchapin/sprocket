==========

This folder contains the figures used by the Sprocket Reference Manual. Most of these figures
are in PIC format. The *.pic file is the source of the figure. It is compiled to a corresponding
*.tex file using the pic tool. Thus the *.tex files here are generated files. Despite that I'm
including them in the repository since access to the pic tool might be difficult for some users.
Thus only those who need to edit the figures need to use pic. It helps that the generated *.tex
files are small.
