\title{SpartanRPC: Remote Procedure Call Authorization in Wireless Sensor Networks}
\author{PETER CHAPIN and CHRISTIAN SKALKA \affil{University of Vermont}}

\begin{abstract}
  We describe SpartanRPC, a secure middleware technology that supports
  cooperation between distinct security domains in wireless sensor
  networks. SpartanRPC extends nesC to provide a link-layer remote
  procedure call (RPC) mechanism, along with an enhancement of
  configuration wirings that allow specification of remote, dynamic
  endpoints. RPC invocation is secured via an authorization logic that
  enables servers to specify access policies, and requires clients to
  prove authorization. This mechanism is implemented using a
  combination of symmetric and public key cryptography. We report on
  benchmark testing of a prototype implementation, and on an
  application of the framework that supports secure collaborative use
  and administration of an existing WSN data gathering system.
