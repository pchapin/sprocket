TITLE: Trust Management in Wireless Sensor Networks

AUTHORS: Peter C. Chapin and Christian Skalka

ABSTRACT: Nodes in a heterogeneous wireless sensor network have a need for specifying and
enforcing rich access control policies. We enhance SpartanRPC, an extension of the nesC language
that supports remote procedure call, to use the RT_0 trust management system for controlling
access to remotely exported resources. Our implementation, currently under development, will
perform all access control computations on the sensor nodes, including both eliptic curve public
key operations and the execution of a dynamically generated Datalog program to compute
authorizations. We intend to explore the feasibility of this implementation and evaluate areas
for future optimizations.
