Duties Benchmark
================

This version of the benchmark exercises the remote procedure call discipline without any
security processing but demonstrates the overhead due to duties (and other supporting SpartanRPC
infrastructure).

Timing the flashing of LED #0 over ~40 seconds shows that the test devices are capable of
posting duties at a maximum rate of 119 posts/s with this program.
