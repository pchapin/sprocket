==========

This version of the benchmark uses normal TinyOS radio facilities directly. It does not use any
sort of RPC mechanism nor does it provide any security services.

Timing the flashing of LED #0 over ~40 seconds shows that the test devices are capable of
sending and receiving 128 messages/s with this program.
