Major differences between the submitted work and the previously
published work include the following.

+ The authorization system in the submitted work has been
  significantly enhanced in terms of its basic model, logical
  specification, and underlying implementation.

  - Model: In the submitted work we assume an open-world model where
    identities of service users need not be known a priori. In our
    previous work we assume a closed-world model where identities of
    users must be known.
 
  - Logical specification: In the submitted work we provide actors a
    rich policy language based on the system RT. In our previous work
    authorization was essentially based on simple access control lists.

  - Implementation: In the submitted work we implement authorization
    credentials as signed certificates, and public-key cryptography
    supports an open-world security model. We also use MACs and
    session keys to establish secure channels for authorized
    communication. In our previous work we only use statically
    assigned symmetric keys (distributed in an unspecified manner) to
    communicate over secure channels. Finally, our new implementation
    includes a set of protcols for in-network RT authorization.
 
+ The programming language defined in the submitted work includes new
  primitive syntax and semantics for managing security policies in the
  authorization logic introduced here.

+ The Empirical Results section has been extended to include results
  based on the new system, including performance measurements pertaining
  to certificate processing, and session key generation.

+ A new application example in a real WSN system has been developed
  and analyzed. Security policies in this application example use the
  authorization logic introduced in this submitted work.

+ The related work discussion has been updated to reflect more recent
  state-of-the-art.
