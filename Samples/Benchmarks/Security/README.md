Security Benchmark
==================

This directory contains a simple "remote blink" application used for benchmark testing of
Spartan RPC duties. This program provides the same functionality as the baseline benchmark
except that it includes full SprocketRT security processing.

To build the client run 'sprocket -n=B' to select the client node's default entity.
To build the server run 'sprocket -n=A' to select the server node's default entity.
