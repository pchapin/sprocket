\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we describe SpartanRPC, a secure middleware technology
  for wireless sensor network (WSN) applications supporting
  cooperation between distinct protection domains. The SpartanRPC
  system extends the nesC programming language to provide a link-layer
  remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, along with an extension of
  nesC configuration wirings that allow specification of remote,
  dynamic endpoints. SpartanRPC also incorporates a capability-based
  security architecture for protection of RPC resources in a
  heterogeneous trust environment, via language-level policy
  specification and enforcement. We discuss an implementation of
  SpartanRPC based on program transformation and AES cryptography, and
  present empirical performance results.
