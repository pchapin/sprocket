TITLE: SpartanRPC: Secure WSN Middleware for Cooperating Domains

AUTHORS: Peter C. Chapin and Christian Skalka

ABSTRACT: SpartanRPC is a secure middleware technology for wireless sensor network (WSN)
applications supporting cooperation between distinct protection domains. The SpartanRPC system
extends the nesC programming language to provide a link-layer remote procedure call (RPC)
mechanism, along with an extension of nesC configuration wirings that allow specification of
remote, dynamic endpoints. SpartanRPC also incorporates a capability-based security architecture
for protection of RPC resources in a heterogeneous trust environment, via language-level policy
specification and enforcement. We discuss an implementation of SpartanRPC based on program
transformation and AES cryptography, and present empirical performance results.
