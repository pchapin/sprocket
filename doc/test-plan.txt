Test Plan
=========

1. Component Timing

These tests exercise the different components of the system in isolation.

+ MAC computation
  a) Program #1: Client -> Server message using traditional Active Message facilities
  b) Program #2: Client -> Server message using unsecured duties
  c) Program #3: Client -> Server message using secure (MAC) duties with preloaded key

+ Session key negotiation time with preloaded public keys.
  a) Client transmits negotiation message
  b) Serve computes session key; sends it's public key to client
  c) Client computes session key

+ Certificate exchange and verification time.
  a) Client transmits a certificate
  b) Server receives certificate and verifies it.


2. Directed Diffusion Timing

These tests exercise the full system in the directed diffusion example. The network consists of
a single node in domain A that is one hop from three nodes in domain B and two hops from an
additional node in domain B.

+ A transmits interest repeatedly (once per second)
  a) How long until that interest is known by all nodes?
  b) When a new node is added, how long does it take for the system to stablize again?

+ The node two hops from A transmits data repeatdly
  a) How long before the data arrives at A?
  b) When a new node is added, how long does it take for the system to stablize again?
