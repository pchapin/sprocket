==========

This folder contains some sample scripts for launching Sprocket and some other related
utilities. See the comments in these files for more information. The 'scripts' folder contains
some Ruby programs for executing tests, etc. In theory the Ruby programs should work on both
Windows and Linux systems.

sprocket.bat      A sample Windows batch file for running the main Sprocket tool.
rtadmin.bat       A sample Windows batch file for running the RTAdmin tool.
sample.sprocket   A sample Sprocket configuration file.

MakeKeys.java     A program that illustrates how to generate ECC keys with BouncyCastle.
setClassPath.bat  A batch file for setting the classpath needed to run MakeKeys.
