Using printf() under TinyOS:

The following comments are from Simone Willett:

There is a tutorial on Printf in the tinyos documentation. All you need is to #include
"printf.h" and include CFLAGS+= -I$(TOSDIR)/lib/printf in the make file.

Then in the command line run this:

java net.tinyos.tools.PrintfClient -comm serial@/dev/tty.usbserial-M4AOLFQL:tmote

Use the name of your own mote (as returned by the motelist command) before the tmote. It is just
like using C's printf.

The next thing to try is seeing the actual packets being sent with something like:

java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/tty.usbserial-M4AOLFQL:tmote

I encountered a few complications when doing this (2011-06-03):

1. The TinyOS documentation wiki does not work. The pages pertaining to printf are just blank
(they contain no data at all... it's as if the web site is closing the connection without
sending anything).

2. The "usual" jar file at $TOSDIR/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar does not actually contain
net.tinyos.tools.PrintfClient class. However the jar file in the latest TinyOS Subversion head
revision does. I believe I'm using official distribution of TinyOS v2.1.1.
