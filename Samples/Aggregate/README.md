Aggregates Sample
=================

This program is in a highly unfinished state. It is intended to demonstrate the use of
Sprocket/SpartanRPC to do in-network data aggregation. In this case nodes act as both clients
and servers. They send requests to each other and receive average temperatures from each other.
Note also that this application must create and maintain some sort of routing tree in the
network.
